# diversity_resilience_analysis

This repository contains the code related toward reproducing the analysis and figures regarding the study entitled:
'Enhanced structural diversity increases European forest resilience and potentially compensates for climate-driven declines'
submitted for review to Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

## Overview
The study consists of an analysis of the relationship between Forest Structural Diversity (FSD) and resilience in selected European forests.
For full details of both the methodolgy and the results please see the published paper.
FSD metrics are derived from the GEDI instrument on board the ISS, and further information can be found: https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2024-471/
Resilience metrics are developed from the variance and temporal autocorrelation of small perturbations in the (deseasonalised, detrended) time series (growing season only) of 500m forest MODIS kNDVI data, aggregated to a scale of 0.05Â°.
A random forest is used to isolate the relationship from confounding, spatially distinct environmental factors.
The emergent relationship is explored as an adaptation measure to preserve forest resilience under climate change.

## resilience_data_collection
These scripts download and collect the publicly available data sources used in this analysis.

## resilience_analysis
This code is used for:
1) Data harmonisation and processing (ie building common dataframes)
2) Building the random forest model
3) Plotting and visualisation related to the performance of the RF model, cross-checking, and the interpretation of results

The code is streamlined for interpretability and producing the main figures only. It therefore does not necessarily include all cross checks and testing described in the methodology or the plotting of supplementary figures.
